The goal of this package is to provide some additional functions for the analysis of field trials in agriculture. It integrates functionalities of packages such as `SpATS`, `lme4`, `ASReml-R`, and `statgenSTA`, to analyse multi-enviromental/trait data in a semi-automatic way.



## Installation

You can install the development version of agriutilities from [GitHub](https://github.com/AparicioJohan/agriutilities) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AparicioJohan/agriutilities")
```

## Automatic Data Analysis Pipeline 

This is a basic example which shows you how to use some of the functions of the package.

### Identify the Experimental Design

The function `check_design_met` helps us to check the quality of the data and also to identify the experimental design of the trials. This works as a quality check or quality control before we fit any model.

```{r example}
library(agriutilities)
library(agridat)
data(besag.met)
dat <- besag.met
results <- check_design_met(
  data = dat,
  genotype = "gen",
  trial = "county",
  traits = "yield",
  rep = "rep",
  block = "block",
  col = "col",
  row = "row"
)
```

Some of the outputs are:
```{r}
print(results)
```


### Single Trial Analysis (STA)

The results of the previous function are used in `single_trial_analysis()` to fit single trial models. This function can fit, Completely Randomized Designs (**CRD**), Randomized Complete Block Designs (**RCBD**), Resolvable Incomplete Block Designs (**res-IBD**), Non-Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**Row-Col**) and Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**res-Row-Col**). 

> **NOTE**: It fits models based on the randomization detected.

```{r}
obj <- single_trial_analysis(results, progress = FALSE)
print(obj)
```

The returning object is a set of lists with trial summary, BLUEs, BLUPs, heritability, variance components, potential extreme observations, and a lot of more things.

### Two-Stage Analysis (MET)
```{r}
met_results <- met_analysis(obj)
print(met_results)
```
