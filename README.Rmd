The goal of this package is to provide some additional functions for the analysis of field trials in agriculture. It extends the functionalities of packages such as SpATS, lme4, ASReml-R, and statgenSTA.

## Installation

You can install the development version of agriutilities from [GitHub](https://github.com/AparicioJohan/agriutilities) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AparicioJohan/agriutilities")
```

## Pipeline Automatic

This is a basic example which shows you how to use some of the functions of the package.

### Identify the Experimental Design

The function `check_design_MET` helps us to check the quality of the data and also to identify the experimental design of the trials. This works as a quality check or quality control before we fit any model.

```{r example}
library(agriutilities)
library(agridat)
data(besag.met)
dat <- besag.met
results <- check_design_MET(
  data = dat,
  genotype = "gen",
  trial = "county",
  traits = "yield",
  rep = "rep",
  block = "block",
  col = "col",
  row = "row"
)
```

Some of the outputs are:

::: row
::: col-md-6
```{r}
results$connectivity_matrix
```
:::

::: col-md-6
```{r}
results$exp_design_list
```
:::
:::

Summary:

```{r}
results$summ_traits
```

### Fitting models based on the randomization

The results of the previous function are used in `single_model_analysis` to fit single trial models.

This function can fit, Completely Randomized Designs (**CRD**), Randomized Complete Block Designs (**RCBD**), Resolvable Incomplete Block Designs (**res-IBD**), Non-Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**Row-Col**) and Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**res-Row-Col**)

```{r}
obj <- single_model_analysis(results, progress = FALSE)
obj$resum_fitted_model
```

The returning object is a set of lists with trial summary, BLUEs, BLUPs, heritability, variance components, potential extreme observations, and a lot of more things.
