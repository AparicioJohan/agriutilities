`agriutilities` is an `R` package designed to make the analysis of
field trials easier and more accessible for everyone working in plant breeding.
It provides a simple and intuitive interface for conducting **single** and
**multi-environmental** trial analysis, with minimal coding required. Whether 
you're a beginner or an experienced user, agriUtilities will help you quickly
and easily carry out complex analyses with confidence. With built-in functions
for fitting Linear Mixed Models (**LMM**), agriUtilities is the ideal choice for
anyone who wants to save time and focus on interpreting their results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of agriutilities from
[GitHub](https://github.com/AparicioJohan/agriutilities) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AparicioJohan/agriutilities")
```

## Automatic Data Analysis Pipeline 

This is a basic example which shows you how to use some of the functions of the
package.

### Identify the Experimental Design

The function `check_design_met` helps us to check the quality of the data and
also to identify the experimental design of the trials. This works as a quality
check or quality control before we fit any model.

```{r example}
library(agriutilities)
library(agridat)
data(besag.met)
dat <- besag.met
results <- check_design_met(
  data = dat,
  genotype = "gen",
  trial = "county",
  traits = "yield",
  rep = "rep",
  block = "block",
  col = "col",
  row = "row"
)
```

### Single Trial Analysis (STA)

The results of the previous function are used in `single_trial_analysis()` to 
fit single trial models. This function can fit, Completely Randomized Designs
(**CRD**), Randomized Complete Block Designs (**RCBD**), Resolvable Incomplete
Block Designs (**res-IBD**), Non-Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**Row-Col**) 
and Resolvable Row-Column Designs (**res-Row-Col**). 

> **NOTE**: It fits models based on the randomization detected.

```{r}
obj <- single_trial_analysis(results, progress = FALSE)
```

The returning object is a set of lists with trial summary, BLUEs, BLUPs,
heritability, variance components, potential extreme observations, residuals,
the models fitted and the data used.

### Two-Stage Analysis (MET)
The results of the previous function are used in `met_analysis()` to 
fit multi-environmental trial models.

```{r}
met_results <- met_analysis(obj)
```

### Inspect the Outputs

```{r}
print(results)
```

<hr>

```{r}
print(obj)
```

<hr>

```{r}
print(met_results)
```
